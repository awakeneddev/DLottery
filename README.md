## 📌 Introduction
DLottery is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that offers a **Multiple Lottery Scheme System**. Users can participate in various lottery schemes by purchasing tickets for each specific scheme. Each lottery scheme has distinct registration opening and closing dates, as well as a final winner announcement date. This transparent, tamper-proof lottery system uses smart contracts to ensure secure handling of funds and unbiased winner selection.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The primary purpose of DLottery is to provide a sophisticated yet practical example of building a decentralized lottery platform with the following objectives:
- Creating multiple lottery schemes with their own lifecycle.
- Ensuring fair winner selection via blockchain-based randomness (using Chainlink VRF).
- Implementing robust security measures for handling funds.
- Building a user-friendly frontend to interact with the smart contracts.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Traditional lottery systems suffer from several limitations, such as:
1. **Lack of Transparency:** Players have to trust a centralized authority to fairly select winners.
2. **High Operational Costs:** Significant revenue goes to intermediaries and administrators.
3. **Security Risks:** Centralized systems can be hacked, manipulated, or corrupted.

DLottery aims to solve these problems by providing a transparent, decentralized, and trustless system where users can participate without relying on a centralized authority.

## 📖 Features
1. **Multiple Lottery Schemes:**
   - Users can participate in different lottery schemes with separate registration windows and draw dates.
2. **Decentralized Ticket Purchase:**
   - Users buy tickets by sending cryptocurrency to the smart contract for each specific scheme.
3. **Random Winner Selection:**
   - A provably fair random number generator (Chainlink VRF) is used to select winners.
4. **Automated Payouts:**
   - Smart contracts automatically transfer the prize pool to the winner's address.
5. **Security Measures:**
   - Reentrancy protection, access control, and gas optimization.
6. **User-friendly Frontend:**
   - Intuitive UI for interacting with various lottery schemes.

## 📅 Project Roadmap
1. **Smart Contract Development:**
   - Implement contracts to handle multiple lottery schemes.
2. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for scheme handling, ticket purchase, and winner selection.
3. **Frontend Development:**
   - Build a React interface for creating schemes, purchasing tickets, and viewing results.
4. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the contracts to a testnet (Goerli or Sepolia).
5. **Future Improvements:**
   - Enhance UI and support multiple blockchain networks.
